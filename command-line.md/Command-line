The command line is a way of navigating your computer entirely through typing text in the terminal. Instead of using the mouse and clicking buttons you are literally typing commands to your computer.
cd change directory allows you to navigate between different directories
mkdir make directory allows you to create new directories
ls list files allows you to see a list of the files inside a directory
pwd print working directory shows you which directory you are currently working in
hostname tells you the name of the computer you are working on
mv move directory move a file/rename a file
rmdir remove directory removes directories when followed by the name of the directory (case sensitive)
rm remove file removes files inside a directory when followed by the name of the file (case sensitive)
touch creates a new empty file
less, more view a file allows you to look at the contents of a file
